## Philosophy

The aim of the project is to enable people to use the Stacks blockchain easily and without a strong technical knowledge. All the interactions should be able to be done via an easy to use and nice looking interface without compromising on security.

## Security

- Your private keys are saved encrypted and never leave your phone. We use [expo SecureStore](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/securestore/) to save your private key encrypted in the secure enclave.
- Over the air updates are disabled, the app can only be updated through the store, or via the APK file. That way an attacker won't be able to inject malicious code via OTA.
